    efficiently. They are knowledgeable in deployment processes, from setting up servers to configuring databases and
    deploying the application.</p>
    
    <p>They are familiar with RESTful APIs and understand the principles of GraphQL. They also have a solid understanding of
    security best practices, ensuring the application and its users are protected.</p>
    
    <p>Lastly, full-stack developers understand the importance of performance optimization, which they apply to the application
    to ensure speed, efficiency, and scalability.</p>
    
    <p>In essence, a full-stack developer is a versatile professional who can handle all aspects of the development process,
